# BMI Calculator

This is a simple C++ program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input for weight and height. The program then displays the BMI value and provides a classification based on the calculated BMI.

## Features

- **BMI Calculation**: The program calculates BMI using the formula:
  \[
  BMI = \frac{weight}{height^2}
  \]
  where `weight` is in kilograms and `height` is in meters.
  
- **BMI Classification**: The program provides feedback based on the calculated BMI value:
  - **Underweight**: BMI less than 18.5
  - **Normal weight**: BMI between 18.5 and 24.9
  - **Overweight**: BMI between 25 and 29.9
  - **Obese**: BMI 30 or higher

## Getting Started
